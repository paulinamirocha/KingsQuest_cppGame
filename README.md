The game is a simple text-based story where the player has to defeat the dragon using a group of available heroes.

I used structs to create the characters, assigning each of them their own name and statistics through variables. When the player recalls them, the pointers change the text to match, informing about the damage dealt to the monster and to the character, and the amount of health left for both of the sides.

The chosen character can be changed after every round, the dragon either fights back or stays idle and does not react, depending on the number of the round.
